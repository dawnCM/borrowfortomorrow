                           centuries. However, if your credit is less than stellar, you can face more challenges than someone with excellent credit. If you are going to ask your family or friends to help out, you should be prepared to discuss it with them as you would a lender. To start, let them know why you need the loan, how much money you need to borrow, when you plan on paying the loan back and what interest rate you will offer them. If you plan on borrowing a large sum, you need to be prepared to discuss a repayment plan. To protect everyone involved, have everything written up and signed by both parties. When you repay the loan or make a payment on the loan, you need to get a signed receipt. This may seem extreme, but it will keep everyone on the same page. You don’t want to end up on Judge Judy and ruin a relationship over a dispute.

                           <strong>Student Loans</strong> 
Student loans are offered to college students and their families to help cover the cost of higher education. There are two main types: federal student loans and private student loans. Federally funded loans are better, as they typically come with lower interest rates and more borrower-friendly repayment terms.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Mortgages</strong>
Mortgages are loans distributed by banks to allow consumers to buy homes they can’t pay for upfront. A mortgage is tied to your home, meaning you risk foreclosure if you fall behind on payments. Mortgages have among the lowest interest rates of all loans.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Auto Loans</strong>
Like mortgages, auto loans are tied to your property. They can help you afford a vehicle, but you risk losing the car if you miss payments. This type of loan may be distributed by a bank or by the car dealership directly. You should understand that while loans from the dealership may be more convenient, they often carry higher interest rates and ultimately cost more overall.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Personal Loans</strong>
Personal loans can be used for any personal expenses and don’t have a designated purpose. This makes them an attractive option for people with outstanding debts, such as credit card debt, who want to reduce their interest rates by transferring balances. Like other loans, personal loan terms depend on your credit history.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Loans for Veterans</strong>
The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has lending programs available to veterans and their families. With a VA-backed home loan, money does not come directly from the administration. Instead, the VA acts as a co-signer and effectively vouches for you, helping you earn higher loan amounts with lower interest rates.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Small Business Loans</strong>
Small business loans are granted to entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs to help them start or expand a business. The best source of small business loans is the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), which offers a variety of options depending on each business’s needs.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Borrowing from Retirement & Life Insurance</strong>
Those with retirement funds or life insurance plans may be eligible to borrow from their accounts. This option has the benefit that you are borrowing from yourself, making repayment much easier and less stressful. However, in some cases, failing to repay such a loan can result in severe tax consequences.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Consolidated Loans</strong>
A consolidated loan is meant to simplify your finances. Simply put, a consolidate loan pays off all or several of your outstanding debts, particularly credit card debt. It means fewer monthly payments and lower interest rates. Consolidated loans are typically in the form of second mortgages or personal loans.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Cash Advances</strong>
A cash advance is a short-term loan against your credit card. Instead of using the credit card to make a purchase or pay for a service, you bring it to a bank or ATM and receive cash to be used for whatever purpose you need. Cash advances also are available by writing a check to payday lenders. 
<br/><br/>
<strong>Home Equity Loans</strong>
If you have equity in your home – the house is worth more than you owe on it – you can use that equity to help pay for big projects. Home equity loans are good for renovating the house, consolidating credit card debt, paying off student loans and many other worthwhile projects. Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) use the borrower’s home as a source of collateral so interest rates are considerably lower than credit cards. The major difference between the two is that a home equity loan has a fixed interest rate and regular monthly payments are expected, while a HELOC has variable rates and offers a flexible payment schedule. Home equity loans and HELOCs are used for things like home renovations, credit card debt consolidation, major medical bills, education expenses and retirement income supplements. They must be repaid in full if the home is sold.

                           potentially the one that is the easiest for the borrower to control, is the borrower's credit rating.<br><br/>
A potential customer's credit worthiness is determined by many factors. Past credit history, ability to repay loans & other obligations and other factors (see credit ratings) all help to determine how a potential lender will view the credit risk of a borrower.<br><br/>
The easiest way for a consumer to see a summary of what a lender will use to determine the borrower’s credit worthiness is by looking at a credit profile from one of the three major credit reporting agencies: Equifax, TransUnion and Experian.<br><br/>
Generally speaking, the better the borrower’s credit rating the lower the borrowing costs will be and the higher the loan amount will be. That said, there are installment lenders that specialize in borrowers with poor credit. So, don't be discouraged if your credit rating is low.<br>
No matter what your credit score there is likely a loan for you. Some lenders don't require a credit check. The best way to find an unsecured installment loan may be to use a third party aggregator. They will present your information to multiple lenders with the purpose of finding you a loan.<br>
Choosing the right aggregator presents a whole new set of obstacles to overcome. You want a company that will have your interests in mind and represent you to potential lenders. Things to look for when choosing a company to represent you to lenders are:<br><br/>

<i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right"></i> Do they have lenders for all credit types?<br>
<i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right"></i> Is their site safe – do they encrypt confidential personal information?<br>
<i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right"></i> Can they provide an instant online decision?<br>
<i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right"></i> How quickly is their process > ie, how quickly can you get funded?<br>
<i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right"></i> Are all documents presented with clear disclosures prior to you obligating yourself?<br>
<i class="fa fa-chevron-circle-right"></i> <strong> THE SERVICE TO YOU, THE BORROWER, SHOULD BE FREE!</strong> <br><br/>

If the company you are looking at to represent you to lenders cannot say yes to all these points, then find another service provider. Never pay a company to provide this service for you!  <br>

These companies are paid by the lenders for referrals. Remember, if you need money fast, with a competitive rate from a reputable company then do your homework first.

                           for your education. 
More than $126 billion in grants, work-study funds, loans, and tax benefits were awarded by the federal government last year to help undergraduate students afford college.
Unlike other types of financial aid, loans must be repaid with interest. Learn the facts about loans and you can borrow wisely.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Federal Stafford Loans (Subsidized and Unsubsidized):</strong>  The Stafford loan is the most common loan that students use to pay for college. If the student qualifies for a subsidized loan, the federal government pays the interest on the loan while the student is in college. Almost any student can get an unsubsidized loan, with the difference being that the student is responsible for paying the interest on the loan while he is in college, although the interest payments can be deferred until shortly after the student graduates or leaves college.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Parent PLUS Loans </strong> 
This federal loan is offered through colleges to parents with relatively good credit. The maximum PLUS loan amount is the difference between the college’s cost of attendance and all of the other aid that your child has been awarded.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Perkins Loans</strong>  
The Perkins loan is awarded by participating colleges to students with exceptional financial need.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Private Student Loans</strong> 
These loans are offered to students by a variety of banks and private lenders. Almost all private student loans these days require a cosigner. They should be called “No Alternative Loans” because they should be your last resort.
