                   NOTICE: A personal loan provides the cash needed to meet an immediate short-term cash flow problem. It is not a solution for longer term financial problems for which longer term financing may be more appropriate. You may want to discuss your financial situation with a nonprofit financial counseling service in your community. You may be charged additional fees if you renew the loan. Please contact your loan provider for details regarding renewal fees or other charges that may be incurred.

                 <p class="terms-p">
                   Arbitration of All Disputes: You and we agree that any and all claims, disputes or controversies between you and us, any claim by either of us against the other (or the employees, officers, directors, agents, servicers or assigns of the other) and any claim arising from or relating to your application for this loan, regarding this loan or any other loan you previously or may later obtain from a lender, this Note, this agreement to arbitrate all disputes, your agreement not to bring, join or participate in class actions, regarding collection of the loan, alleging fraud or misrepresentation, whether under common law or pursuant to federal, state or local statute, regulation or ordinance, including disputes regarding the matters subject to arbitration, or otherwise, shall be resolved by binding individual (and not joint) arbitration by and under the Code of Procedure of the National Arbitration Forum ("NAF") in effect at the time the claim is filed. This agreement to arbitrate all disputes shall apply no matter by whom or against whom the claim is filed. Rules and forms of the NAF may be obtained and all claims shall be filed at any NAF office, on the World Wide Web at www.arb-forum.com, by telephone at 800-474-2371, or at "National Arbitration Forum, P.O. Box 0191, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55405." Your arbitration fees will be waived by the NAF in the event you cannot afford to pay them. The cost of a participatory hearing, if one is held at your or our request, will be paid for solely by us and will take place at a location near your residence. This arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce. It shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. Sections 1-16. Judgment upon the award may be entered by any party in any court having jurisdiction. NOTICE: YOU AND WE HAVE A RIGHT OR OPPORTUNITY TO LITIGATE DISPUTES THROUGH A COURT AND HAVE A JUDGE OR JURY DECIDE THE DISPUTES BUT HAVE AGREED INSTEAD TO RESOLVE DISPUTES THROUGH BINDING ARBITRATION.

You agree to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a lawsuit or to remove you as a participant in the suit. You agree to pay the attorney's fees and court costs we incur in seeking such relief.
