                <p class="tol-p" style="margin-top: 2%;">
                  Loan types vary because each loan has a specific intended use. They can vary by length of time, by how interest rates are calculated, by when payments are due and by a number of other variables.
                </p>

                <h2 class="tol-h2">Student Loans</h2>
                <p class="terms-p">
                  Student loans are offered to college students and their families to help cover the cost of higher education. There are two main types: federal student loans and private student loans. Federally funded loans are better, as they typically come with lower interest rates and more borrower-friendly repayment terms.
                </p>

                <h2 class="tol-h2">Mortgages</h2>
                 <p class="terms-p">
                  Mortgages are loans distributed by banks to allow consumers to buy homes they can’t pay for upfront. A mortgage is tied to your home, meaning you risk foreclosure if you fall behind on payments. Mortgages have among the lowest interest rates of all loans.
                 </p>

                 <h2 class="tol-h2">Auto Loans</h2>
                 <p class="terms-p">
                   Like mortgages, auto loans are tied to your property. They can help you afford a vehicle, but you risk losing the car if you miss payments. This type of loan may be distributed by a bank or by the car dealership directly. You should understand that while loans from the dealership may be more convenient, they often carry higher interest rates and ultimately cost more overall.
                 </p>

                <h2 class="tol-h2">Personal Loans</h2>
                 <p class="terms-p">
                   Personal loans can be used for any personal expenses and don’t have a designated purpose. This makes them an attractive option for people with outstanding debts, such as credit card debt, who want to reduce their interest rates by transferring balances. Like other loans, personal loan terms depend on your credit history.

                 </p>

                <h2 class="tol-h2">Loans for Veterans</h2>
                 <p class="terms-p">
                   The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has lending programs available to veterans and their families. With a VA-backed home loan, money does not come directly from the administration. Instead, the VA acts as a co-signer and effectively vouches for you, helping you earn higher loan amounts with lower interest rates.

                 </p>

                 <h2 class="tol-h2">Small Business Loans</h2>
                 <p class="terms-p">
                   Small business loans are granted to entrepreneurs and aspiring entrepreneurs to help them start or expand a business. The best source of small business loans is the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), which offers a variety of options depending on each business’s needs.
                 </p>

                <h2 class="tol-h2">Borrowing from Retirement & Life Insurance</h2>
                 <p class="terms-p">
                   Those with retirement funds or life insurance plans may be eligible to borrow from their accounts. This option has the benefit that you are borrowing from yourself, making repayment much easier and less stressful. However, in some cases, failing to repay such a loan can result in severe tax consequences.
                 </p>

                  <h2 class="tol-h2">Consolidated Loans</h2>
                 <p class="terms-p">
                   A consolidated loan is meant to simplify your finances. Simply put, a consolidate loan pays off all or several of your outstanding debts, particularly credit card debt. It means fewer monthly payments and lower interest rates. Consolidated loans are typically in the form of second mortgages or personal loans.
                 </p>

                <h2 class="tol-h2">Cash Advances</h2>
                 <p class="terms-p">
                   A cash advance is a short-term loan against your credit card. Instead of using the credit card to make a purchase or pay for a service, you bring it to a bank or ATM and receive cash to be used for whatever purpose you need. Cash advances also are available by writing a check to payday lenders. 
                 </p>

                  <h2 class="tol-h2">Home Equity Loans</h2>
                 <p class="terms-p">
                   If you have equity in your home – the house is worth more than you owe on it – you can use that equity to help pay for big projects. Home equity loans are good for renovating the house, consolidating credit card debt, paying off student loans and many other worthwhile projects. Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOCs) use the borrower’s home as a source of collateral so interest rates are considerably lower than credit cards. The major difference between the two is that a home equity loan has a fixed interest rate and regular monthly payments are expected, while a HELOC has variable rates and offers a flexible payment schedule. Home equity loans and HELOCs are used for things like home renovations, credit card debt consolidation, major medical bills, education expenses and retirement income supplements. They must be repaid in full if the home is sold.
